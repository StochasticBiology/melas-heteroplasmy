# melas-heteroplasmy

This repository contains code supporting the paper ["Mitochondrial DNA density homeostasis accounts for a threshold effect in a cybrid model of a human mitochondrial disease."](https://doi.org/10.1042/BCJ20170651)

This project was completed around 2016, and its first upload to github was made in 2022. Whilst every effort has been made to curate this project for ease of use, the amount of time that has passed and the complexity of the underlying project makes it difficult for us to guarantee that all of the code here is in working order.

If you get stuck using this project, please [raise a git issue](https://github.com/StochasticBiology/melas-heteroplasmy/issues) and we will do our best to help.
