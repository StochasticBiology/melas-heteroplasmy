As stated in the original paper, we derived the values in this file from a trial run of adaptive MCMC.

We won't provide the code for generating these values, just take them as a given.

All they do is make sampling more efficient, in theory if you sample for long enough, any values here will do. You
can verify that the values are "good" from autocorrelation/mixing statistics of your MCMC.
